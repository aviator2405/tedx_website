        <p id="ted-body">TED is a non-profit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started in 1984 as a conference
         where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics from science to business to global issues,
         in more than 100 languages. The two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less.
         Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help to share ideas in communities around the world. TED has become a global phenomenon, 
         influencing how people consume information and inspiring them to think critically about the world around them. The diverse range of speakers 
         and topics covered in TED Talks has contributed to its widespread popularity and impact.</p>
